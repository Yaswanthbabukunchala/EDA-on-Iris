Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Iris Dataset
Overview
The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in the machine learning community. It contains 150 observations of iris flowers from three species â€” Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. For each observation, four features are recorded: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on this dataset is to understand the data's structure, relationships between variables, and identify any patterns that may exist.

Dataset Features
Sepal Length (cm): The length of the sepal of the flower.
Sepal Width (cm): The width of the sepal.
Petal Length (cm): The length of the petal.
Petal Width (cm): The width of the petal.
Species: The species of the flower (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica).
Steps for EDA
1. Importing Necessary Libraries
We start by importing the required libraries for data manipulation and visualization, such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

2. Loading the Dataset
The Iris dataset is loaded from sklearn.datasets and converted into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.

3. Descriptive Statistics
Basic statistics of the dataset, such as mean, standard deviation, and percentiles, are calculated using df.describe() to get an overall sense of the data.

4. Checking for Missing Data
We check for any missing values in the dataset to ensure data completeness.

5. Pairplot for Feature Relationships
A pairplot using seaborn helps visualize the pairwise relationships between the features and highlights species-wise differences.

6. Correlation Heatmap
We create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between different features. Strong correlations may indicate redundancy or provide insights into the relationship between features.

7. Boxplots
Boxplots are generated to understand the distribution of each feature and detect any outliers.

8. Violin Plot by Species
A violin plot is used to visualize the distribution of data for each feature across different species, combining a boxplot and KDE plot.

9. Feature Distributions
We create Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots to visualize the distribution of each feature based on species.

10. Summary of Observations
At the end of the analysis, key observations are summarized:

Strong correlations between petal length and width, which help distinguish species.
Clear separation of Iris-setosa from the other species based on petal features.
Overlap between Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica, but still distinguishable using specific features.
Visualizations
The following visualizations are created in the EDA process:

Pairplots to observe relationships between features.
Correlation heatmap to visualize correlations.
Boxplots and violin plots to understand feature distributions across species.
KDE plots to compare feature distributions.
